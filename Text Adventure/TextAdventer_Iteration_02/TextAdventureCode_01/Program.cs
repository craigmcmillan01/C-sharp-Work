             * 
             * the player should then be allowed to choose a name for Their character and a difficulty level, (Easy, medium, hard)
             * 
             * the select mission method should be run and this should run through all possible missions. (might need to look into if we need to pass a player object to the mission class).
             * 
             * once all missions have been completed the game should end.
